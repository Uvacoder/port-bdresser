            <h3>There is no afterlife, but a version of us lives on nonetheless.</h3>

<p>At the begining of the computer era, people died with passowrds in their heads and no one could 
		access their files. When access to these files was critical, companies would grind to a halt.
		That's when programmers invented death switches.</p>
	<p>With a dealth switch, the computer prompts you for your password once a week to make sure you're still alive.When you don't enter your password for some period of time, the computer deduces you are dead, and you password is automatically emailed to the second-in-command. Individuals began to use death switces to reveal Swiss bank account numbers to their heirs, to get the last word in an argument, and to confess secrets that were unspeadable during their lifetime.</p>
	<p>It soon debame appreciated that death switches provided a good way to say goodbye electronically. Instad of sending out passwords, people began programming their computers to send emails to their friends announcing their own death. "It appears I'm dead now," the email would begin. "I'll take this as an opportunity to tell you things I've always wanted to express..."</p>

<h3>We hope you enjoyed your stay.</h3>

<p>Soon enough, people realized the could program messages to be delivered on dates in the future. "Happy 87th birthday. It's been twenty-two years since my death. I hope your life is proceeding delightfully."</p>
	<p>With time, people began to push death switches further. Instead of confessing their death in the emails, they preteneded they were not dead at all. Using auto-responder algorithms that cleverly analyzed incoming messages, a death switch could generate apologetic excuses to turn down invitations, to send congratulations on a life event, and to claim to be looking forward to a chance to see someone again soon.</p>
	<p>Today building a death switch to pretent you are not dead has become an art form. Death switches are programmed to send a fax occasionally, make a transfer between bank accounts, or make an online purchase of the latest novel. The most sophisticated switches reminisce about shared adventures, exchange memories about a good escapade, swap inside jokes, brag about past feats, and summon up lifetimes of experience.</p>
	<p>In this way, death switches have established themselves as a cosmic joke on reality. Humans have discovered that they cannot stop Death, but at least they can spit in his drink.</p>
	<p>This began as a good-spirited revolution against the grave's silence. The problem for those of us still living, however, is the increasing difficulty in determining wh's dead and who's alive. Computers operate around teh clock, sending out the social intercourse of the dead: greetings, condolences, invitations, excuses, flirtations, small talk, inside jokes — codes between people who know each other well. </p>
	<p>And it is clear now where this society is going. Most people have died off, and we are some of the few remaining. By the time we die and our death switches are triggered, there will be nothing left but a sophisticaed network of transactions with no one to read them: a society of email zipping back and forth under silent staellites orbiting a soundless planet.</p>

<h3>You won’t read this.</h3>
<p>So an afterlife does not exist for us per se, but instead an afterlife occurs for that which exists between us. When an alien civilization eventually bumps into Earth, they will immediately be able to understand what humans were about, because what will reamin is the network of relationships: who lived whom, who competed, who cheated, who laughed together over road tops and holiday dinners. Each person's ties to bosses, brothers, and liver are etched into the electronic communiques. The death switches simulate the society so completely that the entire social network is reconstructable. The plante's memories survive even in zeros and ones. </p>
	<p>The situation allows us indefinitely to revisit shared jokes, remedy lost opportunities for a kind word, and recall stories about delightful Earthly experiences that can no longer be felt. Memories noe live on their own; no on forgets them or grows tired of telling them. We are quite satisfied with this arrangement, because reminiscing about our glory days of existence is perhaps all that would have happened in the afterlife anyway.</p>
