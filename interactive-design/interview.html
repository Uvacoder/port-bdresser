		<p class="question">When and why did you start creating art?</p>
		<p class="answer">Discovering the web when I was in middle school and wanting to make a website but not having anything to put on it, I started to make digital collages in some Photoshop knock-off that came with my Windows installation. Really though the 'art' was just an excuse to build a means publish it. Throughout high school I continued to make websites and the distinction between the 'content' and the 'interface' started to blur. It's interesting looking back to see how much of an effect the mode of publishing has always had on my work.</p>
<br><br>
		<p class="question">What/who are you inspired or influenced by?</p>
		<p class="answer">Roni Horn, Robert Irwin, Chris Kraus, Robert Smithson, Duchamp, Robert Morris, Rich Hickey, Alan Kay (and the VPRI), Ted Nelson, Dexter Sinister, Shannon Ebner, NIST, Seth Price, David Batchelor, On Kawara, Nelson Goodman, William Gibson, Anne Truitt, <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/">Jodi</a>, Katharina Grosse, Walter de Maria, Tom Burr</p>
<br><br>
		<p class="question">Your work is very diverse -- image, video, sound, paper, glass, code. What dictates the medium you choose for each piece? How does its relationship with technology influence the work?</p>
		<p class="answer">I hope that the things I make just take precisely the material form they have to be.

		For example

		I did a <a href="http://www.damonzucconi.com/show/untitled-gamblin-radiant-blue">series of works</a> that are solid rubber because of it's characterization as an isotropic material -- its uniformity in every direction. My original interest stemming from a more historical conception of directionality in modernist painting.
<br><br>
		Or <a href="http://www.damonzucconi.com/show/corrasable-2">these pieces</a> which are on a particular kind of outmoded typewriter paper that's erasable. A forgotten step on the way to word processing.
<br><br>
		I've never really been proficient in one particular kind of making, either.
<br><br>
		As far as the work's relationship with technology goes... It's only a recent development that I've learned to program in any kind of real sense (writing a program from scratch), but It's had a large effect on the kinds of works that I make regardless of the material form they wind up taking. (In the same sense that the kinds of interfaces we use to publish on the web often dictates the kinds of content that gets published and subsequently consumed.)
<br><br>
		My understanding of the transformative potential of an archive came from using a content management system for the first time, which gave me a tight feedback loop between the studio, publishing and archiving. I later learned that this same kind of creative power is embodied perfectly in the idea of a REPL.</p>
<br><br>
		<p class="question">How would you describe your art to your parents?</p>
		<p class="answer">Despite all their support, we've never really discussed it. I still have trouble describing the work I make to anyone though when it's in any kind of general terms.

		Lately I find I'm describing myself to others using the word 'programmer'â€”a title that I like for a double meaning: a software developer, but also that of the many things that can be programmed: materials, activities, spaces, events.</p>
<br><br>
		<p class="question">What are you working on now, what are you interested in exploring next?</p>
		<p class="answer">In the studio today:

		I was trying to find a florist that can get me a particular kind of rose that's been genetically modified to have the pigment delphinidin (responsible for the color blue) for a photo series I'm trying to do. It's a kind of extension of <a href="http://www.damonzucconi.com/show/suntory-blue">this piece </a> (which is a promotional photo of that rose interlaced with a copy of itself that's hue rotated 180 degrees, then continuously animated to rotate its hue 360 degrees)
<br><br>
		I worked a bit on a project that maybe will wind up in the form of a book. I've been scraping together a dataset composed of various English language color name dictionaries. A kind of meta-dictionary of as many different color naming systems as possible. A lot of my work lately seems to involve data scraping/cleansing.
<br><br>
		I made some "unfair" coins and flipped them.
<br><br>
		Some other things on my mind:
<br><br>
		I have a Markov Chain trained on a huge vocal trance lyrics corpus that I'm still trying to figure out what to do with.
<br><br>
		I've have a prototype of a speech synthesis engine that I hope to finish sometime soon. It uses a growing set of phonemes sampled from different voices. Each phoneme of a word is pronounced by an individual person. So a single word might take four or five different people to pronounce it. A chimeric tongue.</p>
