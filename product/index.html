					<p class="project-title">hillaryclinton.com/donate <span>1/16 - 10/16</span></p>
					<p class="project-info">I led optimization and feature development for the Clinton campaign’s online donation platform. We ran
						dozens of multivariate experiments to maximize revenue, testing everything from small visual tweaks to large functional redesigns.
						This data-first approach let us understand how donor behavior differs across traffic sources and
						kept our allocation of development time closely tied to the product’s key success metrics.</br></br>
						Our team also invested heavily in performance, eventually scrapping our isomorphic React / Flux stack
						in favor of a custom vanilla JS framework built in-house. </br></br>
						The platform we built raised money from over 3 million individual donors,
						grew a pool of 1.2 million account holders with saved payment info, and raised hundreds of millions of dollars.

					<p class="project-title">Zipper, an SMS fundraising tool <span>8/1/2016</span></p>
					<div class="project-info">
						<p class="">At Hillary for America, we grew a robust SMS program that the campaign used for GOTV, volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and much more.
						My team built a backend service and data pipeline to let users donate to the campaign by just texting a dollar amount. This
						development and success of this product was the result of broad collaboration across the fundraising, legal, and digital organizing teams. </br></br>
						The feature was available to the 1.2 million users with saved payment information on hillaryclinton.com.
						When a user completed a donation on our web flow, we asked if they wanted to save their payment info and join our SMS program. This
					 	allowed us to securely link a phone number on our SMS list to an account on our website and a payment token with Stripe. During key
						fundraising moments, we could text this eligible audience and prompt them to donate immediately. <br></br>
						We ran several tests to optimize the wording and timing of these SMS "quick donate" asks. This feature alone raised over $1.5 million
						dollars in the last stretch of the campaign.</p>
