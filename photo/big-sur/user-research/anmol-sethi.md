Interviewers: Kathy + Bobby


*How'd you get involved with open source?*
- Started back in high school. I was just finding bugs here and there, I didn’t write code much. 
- I was filing issues on various repos and bug trackers. But as every oss contributor finds, bugs are fixed fastest when you fix them yourself. 
- Eventually I learned to code and started fixing those issues myself.

*How do you find these communities / how did you get involved?*
- I was using GoLang — at the time, Go support was very experimental. I found bugs frequently and filed them on GH. It was why I created my GH account. 
- When I started to write more Go, I started to publish some more of my projects. It was a great way to show off my work. 
- Then I got into Vim and NeoVim—GH is a great place for plugins for these technologies. I started to write plugins and publish them on GH.
- After that, I stopped contributing as much to that community. I started to work on random Go stuff. Searching through things, issues, discussions—
- Now I work at a company that has a pretty big OSS presence, and I manage their developer relations.
- When you do it for no reason, it’s a pursuit of passion. There’s a childlike curiosity.

*What motivates you to contribute?*
- There’s a lot of setup in society in terms of  reward paths. You do something specific and you get a reward for it and then you optimize for that. 
- **What I like about OSS is that the only reward is recognition. The only reason people use tools I built is because it’s good. It’s not because of who I am—it’s because the tool is useful.**
- It’s great to have an impact on the world. The other day someone from the other side of the world filed an issue bug. 

*How do you know people appreciate your work?*
- The primary way is GH issues—they’ll throw in there that they appreciate my time and the work that I’ve done. 
- Sometimes I get emails too—I appreciate those a ton.
- Sometimes my projects get forked.
- Terminful—at the time no Go lib for it, no documentation. I had to reverse engineer it from the C library. The maintainer of the commandline library forked it, and now it’s so widely used. I didn’t get any recognition for that, but my work was used and made an impact on other projects. The maintainer emailed me later thanking me for my work and I appreciated that.

*How do you show appreciation for others’ work? How do others show appreciation for your work?* 
- **I draw inspiration from how people show appreciation to me.**
- **If I come across a lib that I really like, or a blog post I really like, I’ll send an email to let them know that I really appreciated their work. I try to keep it positive.**
- **Sometimes I add a PR, I add a note that thanks them for their work. This is something I really like when others do in my projects—innovating on my work.**

*Is there anything on GitHub that you are particularly proud of? How do you display this work to the outside world?*
- I’ve been using my GH as my personal portfolio for years. 
- But in terms of specific UI—it bothers me that there’s such a limited # of repos that I can pin. 6 is not enough for me. I only have 4 right now, but I felt it was limiting in the past.
- When I go to the repos page under profile, it displays all my forks. I don’t like that—I want people to see my original projects, not my forks necessarily.
- I really like the contributions page (activity timeline).
- I don’t like that some of the contributions have disappeared. I had removed a certain email from my account, and now they’re not tracked anymore. It sucks.
- **I wish I could sort my projects by hierarchy.** Some of them are Go libs, some are CLI things.. I wish there was a folder where I can organize things.

*When you pin something, why do you pin it?*
- I pin things because I’ve been involved. I’ve had neovim pinned. It was something I was working on—it was something I wanted to share with others and the project is good.
- I might be proud of the work, and pin the project.
- Or, at my current company, that has 30k stars—I was involved in that, and it’s nice to be able to pin to my profile.
- Right now, things are a little arbitrary. They don’t know what my level of commits were to those projects.
- **The README you added was a great step towards that. It adds context.**
- I do think it kind of duplicates the bio in the sidebar.

*If you are involved in other online communities, does your experience and involvement with [this project] help in any way? Do you want it to?*
- **My GH is the reason I have my job. People can go through all my work.**
- **I want to be able to show lifetime contributions, not just the past year.** Have it be a resume.

*How do you want to represent that?*
- I like the graph that shows and the specific days. I’m not 100% sure about this, but make it as big to account for every single day. It’d be cool to be able to show 10k contributions over lifetime.

*Is that number really motivating?*
- Yes, yes. Sometimes I look back and feel really proud. This year, it’s the highest that it’s ever been. It feels good that I’m doing more and more.

*What are your other digital habits?*
- I try to be as minimal as possible. I don’t really keep any bookmarks. I go on reddit and hackernews, but I don’t do anything. They’ll feel like a chore I have to do later. I try to keep it in my head, and if I can’t keep it in my head, then it’s not worth tracking. By keeping things in my head, I’m always focusing on what I wanna focus on.

*How frequently are you interacting with someone you don’t know? What information is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?*
- Most of the time, people create GH accounts just to file the issue. 
- I take the thing a lot more seriously if it’s someone who is prominent. **An established GH profile makes me take their filed issues more seriously.** 
- I don’t know who they are, where they’re coming from, and why I should listen to them otherwise.
- When I'm looking at their profile, I look at: Repos with stars. Number of contributions. Number of followers. 
- I notice myself following the numbers—if I can’t get anything from that, I might go thru their actual code or repos.

*What types of contributions do you think are undervalued or underappreciated? What contributions would you like to see more of in your communities?*
- At my current company, we added a bot to automatically merge PRs. It reduces the number of buttons you have to click. 
- Squashing should be the default work method.
- The reason it frustrates me—after I include the title and body, then I have to duplicate it on GH. And then it doesn’t auto-update. 

*What drains you about participating in this community? What do you wish were different, or easier?*
- Low effort users—people who don’t even read the template. New users don’t know you have to mark the to-do list with a little `x`. 
- Another thing that bothers me—PR messages. I want to enforce a formatting on them. There’s no easy way to do that right now. It’s one reason I prefer squashing.
