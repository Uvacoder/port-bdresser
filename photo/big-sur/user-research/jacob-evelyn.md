**Context**
Jacob is a friend/acquaintance from college. I saw he had opened [an issue on Isaacs](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1532) and sent something in to helpdesk around showcasing OS contributions, so I reached out.

*What’s your open source participation like? Have you worked with other open source projects?*
* Not sure how I got involved at first. I was probably fixing something broken that I depended on for my work
* I do maintain one or two projects that have occasional PRs and issues. I'd call myself a “maintainer light.”
* At Panorama [his work] we have a few small projects with minimal traffic
* Within panorama, I’ve seen this pattern of people working around a problem with a lib or dependency, rather than trying to fix it themselves – they don’t even think it’s something we have the power to change
* I’ve been trying to get people more comfortable with the whole open source process.. And it’s scary!
* I’ve mentored these folks through their first contribution, which is ultimately really exciting for them! **And afterwards I wish there were a better way for them to have a “wow i contributed to rails” moment**
* Discovery is hard too. During Women's History Month – I was hoping to organize a thing where my team contributes to projects maintained by non-cis men – they REALLY hard to find.
* Both parts were hard -- looking for something specific overall, AND finding projects of this type [because of the demographics of GitHub].
* We’re comfortable with Ruby, which is a little past its prime… and it's maybe a less inclusive community
* This is based on experience with ruby projects

*Why is it scary?*
* There’s a fear that you will do something wrong, do something” stupid” and get yelled at… and i don’t think this fear is unfounded and it varies from project to project. You only need to see it once to be scared
* In general, **the comms style across the site is particularly hard stacked in favor of the white dude**. You know?

*Do you feel like your contributions to open source are recognized? How do you know? Do you think this recognition is sufficient? (Maybe walk us through an example?)*
* I know a contribution was appreciated when... **best case scenario, people have given me little reactions <3, which show that other community members care. Maybe maintainer thanks me in a PR comment. It's a good sign when they immediately release a new version with my changes.**
* It sucks when something gets merged but never released
* **Back when I was getting started, it was really exciting to go to the contributors page and see my avatar!!!! Or I was really sad the couple times that I contributed but wasn't in the top 200...**



*How do you represent this work to the outside world? Do you want to? Does GitHub make this easier or harder?*
* **It would be really nice if later on someone could see like “Oh, Jacob contributed to X”**

*Why do you want to show this?*
* Hubris (hehe)
* I think it helps convey.. **it’s that sort of resume aspect of it. I haven’t really used gh to search for a job, but as someone who interviews other engineers, it’d be useful to see this on someone’s github, and right now it’s hard for me to see… did they fork the repo and never do anything, or are they a core member, or what?**

*What specifically would you want ppl to know about your contributions? What wouldn't you want them to know?*
* **I'd want them to know what I added! Was it a big feature? Was I mentoring someone? That stuff**.
* A project I helped with [had the maintainer] go on and say some bad political speech, if that were something on my profile i’d probably want to hide it….
* **There are many ways to contribute… it would be cool to highlight more of those those**
* **In project X you wrote code, but in Y you wrote docs or triaged issues, or mentored people…**

*How do you recognize this effort within your team at work?*
* No real formal structures for it… generally 1-1 thanks
* If it’s a bigger thing, you’re encouraged to share it more widely (“here’s this cool thing I did”)

*If you are involved in other online communities, does your experience and involvement with [this project] help in any way? Do you want it to?*
* Between two projects the experience is translatable, general patterns with how to interact with a community
* Sometimes projects depend on each other and that experience is helpful
* One idea I had: you guys should have way to link projects and surface who depends on what
* Stack Overflow does cool stuff around recognition. **On your profile they show some vanity stats just for you -- “your answers have been viewed by 1b people” -- you guys could do like “your code runs 10x places, etc”**

*[A couple mins later]*
* Another thing on my mind... at this point, it's generally more work to mentor someone else to do a PR than to just do it myself. But that doesn't scale, right?
* From identity standpoint, **is it possible to recognize people who community building / mentorship work? Because if I can get a badge for being a friendly helpful guy, I'm going to do it.**


*How do you get signals about a community, whether it's welcoming or not, whether it's a good place to put your time?*
* First thing I look at is the most recent commit. Was it recent or long time ago? **If it hasn’t been touched in a long time (over year) it’s dead**. [active today badge?]
* README tells me a lot… does it exist? Has someone put thought in to it? Does it have info for newcomers?

*What information is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?*
* I don’t do a lot of context gathering… a lot of it is implicit from what they’re writing. When someone makes a comment or code review or whatever, I don't really look at their profile.
