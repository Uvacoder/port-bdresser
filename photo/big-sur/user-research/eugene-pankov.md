_Can you tell us a bit about yourself, your role with [your community ], and how you got involved?_
*   My first big OSS project was [Ajenti](https://github.com/Eugeny/ajenti-v). It’s not quite a success story. It died off after 5 years, I struggled to get contributors.
*   I really tried to build an ecosystem around it, having lots of examples, support forums, when GH issues weren’t that great for general discussions, and I used a helpdesk to set up external forums.
*   Part of this was because most of our contributors were beginners. They made up a lot of the issues that came in, such as “I don’t know how to get PHP going”. I basically had to process all the tickets myself, and eventually this project went into maintenance mode. Not really developing new features.
*   Few years later, I tried to reimagine it as a toolbox. There are more people who help manage the discussions now. In the last year, I got a great guy in Germany and extending the panel to more workshops, taking more coding work from me. I now mostly review pull requests and whatnot.

*Difference between these two chapters?*
*   I think it was the target audience. One was towards beginners, setting up their first website.

*What information is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?*
*   I don’t really cyberstalk, I just work off of what they post to the issue.

*Do you ever use the “contributors” section of your repo? What for?*
*   I don’t use it very much, it’s not super detailed and not that relevant

*Could you tell us about how you express appreciation for your contributors’ work? Are there any specific tools you use to help with this? Is there a larger idea, user insight, or philosophy?*
*   **I was using the end of the README to list out major contributors**. I was using allcontributors bot. I knew it would be nice for people to see themselves in the repos they participate in. **Especially those who take care of the actionable issues i.e. the people who resolve the issue.**
*   My sister started contributing recently. Getting her PR properly labeled, getting something merged, getting in the changelog – it was really cool to her to see other people involved with her code, and I think **having her name in the changelog & contributors page was meaningful to her. **
*   For me, If I were going to the repo and merge the PR, it wouldn’t mean as much to me.

*Is there anything you’d like to recognize people for that you’re not able to communicate now? Anything allcontributors leaves out?*
*   I think the allcontributors bot is actually pretty extensive.
*   **The biggest problem with it... it’s very hard to put everything in**. You go in and ask the bot to open a ticket for every user...You have to type in all the this and that to the bot, and then all the merge process, etc… it’s a lot of work if you’re doing it for a lot of people.
*   **Some people think the allcontributors bot is virtue signaling**. It’d be great to extend contributor insights, perhaps? [Kathy note: I found this really interesting. i.e. if GitHub doesn't formalize the recognition process and it's manually done by a maintainer... people can end up dumping on the person who is doing it, which suuuucks]

*What do you want to encourage your community to do more of?*
*   I have these community members who have started to help me with issue triage, asking followup questions and repro steps, etc. These people are really helpful.
*   **I would love to give these folks something like a badge for community mods** — this isn’t someone who’s just poking around for a few minutes, but someone who has deep knowledge about this repo and community. The people who resolve “good issues” getting to add to their reputation with this work.
*   Maybe this badge could also come with some additional triage permissions
*   Maybe I can use a label on issues to help suss out different types of contributions / contributors. Recognizing people at different levels of participation...**Cuz sometimes an issue with a ton of thumbs up doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a super important issue.**
*   I’d even like to thank people for following the issue template and opening a really good issue, like a great bug find with good repro steps, etc.

*What motivates you to participate in this community?*
*   Leaving a mark on the open source world
*   Giving folks something usable
*   Getting people to have a good time while they’re using their tool

*How do you represent this work to the outside world? Do you want to? Does GitHub make this easier or harder?*
*   Pinned repos are awesome. **But for other users who don’t have popular starred repos, it would be really cool if those people could show how they’re participating in the projects that they help out with**. Maybe a spider graph for each community or something.
*   The activity overview is huge. Ideas for something else: Maybe some kind of score would be cool.. Contributing since [year]. When I venn diagram on my profile, it’s mostly commits – it should totally show other types of contributing too, issues, comments, review, etc.

*What do you want people to know about you?*
*   See a role for your pinned repositories – maybe i’m maintainer, maybe i’m making commits, or maybe i’m jus driving by and making issues
*   It’s not just about the code I add, there are a lot of other ways to contribute

**Other notes**
*   I know you have discussions in the beta. I’d love to test it out.
*   It’d be good to add fuzzy search for existing issues. Make it very prominent, like in StackOverflow. Prevent people to post duplicates all the time.
*   When I close an issue as a duplicate, it should have a better link to the issue that’s still open. When people search for an issue, the default is for open issues only, so closed issues where a thing is resolved could help users help themselves and right now they’re hidden.
*   In the future, we’ll probably need some solution for the big list of contributors in the readme. My sister started contributing recently. Getting her PR properly labeled, getting something merged, getting in the changelog. If I were going to the repo and merge the PR, it wouldn’t mean as much to me.
