**Interviewee**: Nell Shamrell (Rust, Chef, Mozilla, etc.)  
**Interviewers**: Kathy + Bobby


*Can you tell us a bit about yourself, and your history with open source communities?*

* I’m Nell — staff engineer at Mozilla. 
* Mostly ecosystem projects. 
* I was at Chef for 5 years before that, which was 500 OSS projects spread across GH. 
* Before that, sporadic OSS, and several closed source jobs.

*How do you find these communities / how did you get involved?*

* Word of mouth for the most part. 
* Rust comm I found because I was working at Chef. 
* Also I found some OSS thru using their projects, and making PRs to them.

*What do you look for before participating?*

* To get started, Code of Conduct is important. I also check for a contributors.md. 
* Also I look for `good first issue` or `beginner`. Even though I’m not a beginner, it’s often the best place to start. It tells me that the project is actively maintained and the maintainer is decent to work with. I want to know whether I will be welcome to the community, versus people seeing my PR and asking, “who the hell are you?”

What motivates you to contribute? 
* Often it’s something that’s bothering me about the user of the project. Sometimes it’s documentation or a feature I need. 
* I always ask the maintainer beforehand if it’s a feature. 
* The people that I mentor are looking to get any OSS experience they can. 

Tell us more about mentorship?
* I’m on the board of a nonprofit called Operation Code. I’m their former CTO.
* We teach programming skills to veterans. They don’t come with traditional computer science background. They come from a culture where there is an emphasis on “we”. The tech industry has an emphasis on “I”— when you use "we" it's interpreted as not actually having done something yourself. 
* Having demonstrable coding OSS experience to bring to interviews is important to them.

Do you feel like your work is appreciated by the communities you participate in? How do the communities or community members show this appreciation?

* Whenever someone does any sort of contribution, even if you can’t merge it, you should say thank you. 
* **A lot of repos have bots that now do that, but it’s not very personal. That's not the personal recognition that I’m looking for**. Like, the gifs are funny, but **it means way more when it comes from a real person.** 

Do you have an example from a time you received personal recognition that felt meaningful?

* When I started contributing to Chef products, **getting a thank you from the maintainers was meaningful, and having the maintainers be responsive. A twitter shout out is nice.** 
* **Being a part of the release notes is meaningful to me, too. That has happened a couple times for me and I really appreciated it.** Like, getting a mention there that I helped with something that's now part of production. 

How do you represent your OS work to the outside world? Do you want to? Does GitHub make this easier or harder? [I see you list them on your website – why?]

* I used to list them on my personal website, but there’s just too many now. 
* The GH profile page with the green squares is adequate
* **I would like to be able to show how projects are most used by communities. Like a PR that fixed something important, or a repo that is a really crucial dependency for a community.** There’s no easy way to do that.


Is there anything on GitHub that you are particularly proud of? 
* For an outsider who asks for a code sample, I’ll send them my Rust chatbot because it doesn’t need a lot of context to understand. 
For people who know Rust, I’ll send them a PR to the Rust compiler, because it’s more impressive, but also requires context. 

If you are involved in other online communities, does your experience and involvement with [this project] help in any way? Do you want it to?
* Yes, very much.

How?
* Word of mouth. **I often ask someone to help me gain credibility in the community. It will always weigh more if someone else says it rather than me.** Often reaching out to one of the maintainers, which I’m fortunate to have those relationships. And, with being a woman in tech, it’s really helpful to have someone else elevate you.
* It’s also helpful to have a “difficulty anchor” – someone with credibility in the group who can benchmark that what you’re doing actually is really hard, so it’s less easy for people to say “well if she can do it, it was probably easy.”

What if you didn’t have that strong personal connection?
* **Having a portfolio page may be helpful in that case.** It’s hard to write the context of that work, but it’s a starting point.

What types of contributions do you think are undervalued or underappreciated? What contributions would you like to see more of from your community? 
* **Encouraging a maintainer to say thank you when a PR is opened, or some other good work is done. It’s kind of universal**, across languages (spoken languages). It’s common to know what English “thank you” means. 
* Having someone be assigned to be a mentor on issues is helpful. We were doing that in Rust. Have people say that they’re willing to look into some part of the codebase or answer questions. It’s usually included as a comment in the issue (who you can @ mention or loop in when you need help.)

How frequently are you interacting with someone you don’t know? What information is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?
* With Rust, frequently. Half of the time, maybe 25-50%. 
* I do work to find context about that person. It’s often a Google search. It’s hard if their name is super common— **I’ll do some research, I’ll look at other communities they’re involved in and how those interactions happen.**
* It helps me have a successful interaction with them. **When you mention previous work that someone has done, it establishes a level of trust pretty quickly.** It helps us establish rapport.
* Finding comments they’ve made on GitHub is also quite helpful. I have sometimes found negative interactions in other communities, and then I try to limit my interactions. No excuse for abuse. Sometimes you do need to work with someone you don’t like though. 

Are there communities where you stopped participating? Why? In your experience, why do people leave the community or stop contributing?
* Time is usually a big reason. I stopped participating in Chef when I left it becuase I didn't have time. 
* I also stopped when there is too much noise, because I mute the project and then just forget to look at the project.

Anything else you want to share with us? 
* [Bobby: What’s celebrated in one place isn’t necessarily celebrated elsewhere. How do we bring that context to broader audiences?]
* **The audience for GH is changing. I came in 10 years ago, and I came in through a project, I have an issue, I’m going to submit a PR. That’s the old way.**
* **The new way is someone is looking to get coding experience, and they want to do that via OSS. They might not necessarily use the project, but they see that the maintainers are good to interact with and then look to get the experience by working for that project.**
* Not all projects understand the above. Linux Kernel, no. Newer front-end frameworks may understand this more.
* I went back to taking an academic CS course in 15 years. It’s such a different mindset now. The work you get in an academic setting isn’t really framed the same way in the real world.
