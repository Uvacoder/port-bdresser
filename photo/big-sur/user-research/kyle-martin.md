*Can you tell us a bit about yourself, your role with [your community ], and how you got involved?*
* Have been a JS developer for a many years
* For a while, **I found it hard to find the right projects to work on**
* Mostly contributing to node best practices repository
* They were creating a new section on security best practices, so I figured I could add some content since that's my specialty, so I added one idea that was well received, then just kept working


*Could you describe this community? How do contributions work? Is there a core team, and how often do you receive contributions from outside this team?*
* There's a core group of 5 maintainers, then we get hundreds of contributions [not sure over how long..]
* Our community is mostly about maintaining this guide to node and how to write clean code. So it's mostly content.
* As far as contributions, we get a lot of small stuff – a typo, adding a bullet point. Some larger stuff like translations or new sections on new ideas.


*Could you tell us about how you express appreciation for your contributors’ work? Are there any specific tools you use to help with this? Is there a larger idea, user insight, or philosophy?*
* They used to have their own system for acknowledging contributors. **It's actually what got me involved in the first place**. If you suggested a best practice [additional content], you’d get a gold star next to your name [in the README]. They also had a flower, which represented a contribution – maybe a spelling mistake, or writing a whole new section, etc
* Actually yeah, let me look it up,... Flower is successful PR, star is approved new “best practice”
* **So when I was looking around, I saw this repo and the list of contributors, and I wanted my name on there**

*Seeing the list was motivating for you to get involved with the project?*
* **I was definitely motivated by seeing this list, yeah – there weren’t that many people there, and I was trying to build up my CV, so I wanted to get on the list**

*You were interested in helping out so you could build up a resume? How did you represent your work in this community to the outside world? Did GitHub make this easier or harder?*
* Eventually I got added to the “steering committee of the project” – **for me, this is a big source of recognition** [It's a section in the README above the list of all the other contributors, and includes a headshot and a short bio.]
* **Having public organizations on my profile is a decent way of showing you’re a part of something, but it could definitely do more there... like it doesn't show what I'm doing in each org, you know?**
* **We wanted to create a *new* org for node best practices to have that represented on the profile, but the creator wanted the project on his own profile because it got him a lot of freelancing gigs**, so we never created an org for it. I was kinda bummed out by that.

*What would you change or improve about the the way you recognize your community? Is it effective?*
* So when I started to help out, I realized that [the way we recognized contributors] was really not efficient. We Would open an issue for March, gradually add people to this issue
* Once a month, we'd group all the people from the issue and add them to the README [with appropriate star or flower]
* Eventually I saw the allcontributors bot and we picked it up
* **Thought it was nice – even if you’re not adding code, you’re still recognized**
* And the bot made it a lot easier to automate what we were already doing
* In general, I have a lot of other ideas. **I like the sidebar here [on the profile page] and I want something like that for our repo too, so you can see who's a maintainer, or a contributor, or whatever**
* I also **want to show that I'm a “maintainer” on my own profile – I put a lot of time in to working on that** so I'd like it to be out there.



*What behaviors do you want to encourage in your community? How do you encourage this behavior?*
* We mostly use README to tell visitors what to do, how to start. There's a section “Three things you ought to know”
* We also have writing and contributing guidelines


*What types of contributions would you like to see more of from your community?* [I think I mis-worded this on the call]
* We do okay, we get a fair number of people
* We have Twitter, use this to share updates and invite people who might know a lot about a specific topic
* Also use Medium and get all sorts of people from there
* **But it would be really cool to to tag our repository for “contributions wanted” or "needs Spanish translation" abd that could bubble up in the Trending or Explore section**. Or we could select Javascript or Node or something and people looking for projects like that could find us better.

*What information is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?*
* It’s hard. We don’t have anything set in stone about what we need to know about them, but we try to jump in quickly and be welcoming no matter what
* Most responses are delegated pretty well – we have specialist areas, so if someone is changing “security” it comes to me to review, because I’m in charge of that section
* To learn about people, I guess I go to their profile. I quite like activity view, that’s nice. I can see what they commit to each project, understand what they’re up to

*Some other ideas...*
* There are these other sites I used when I was looking for projects to get started
