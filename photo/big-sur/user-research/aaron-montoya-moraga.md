*Can you tell us a bit about yourself, your role with p5.js, and how you got involved with the community?*

30, from Chile. Code was very painful for me. First class I got an F! For three years, it was traumatic. The process was painful and expensive (books, buying new software). We weren’t set up to purchase learning materials in Chile. We never talked about the politics of software. You have to study 6 years of engineering to get a degree.

Before p5, I didn’t care about the web. I saw that.. If I put something on the web, it’s going to be accessible to everyone (people don’t need to physically go somewhere, park their car, etc). It’s open source and shareable, too.

My first year, I don’t know terminal, I don’t know git. I stepped down and took a month off from grad school. I learned terminal, git. I kept things in Dropbox but discovered GitHub. I really admire Kyle McDonald (maybe this person?)

Something we were talking about with Processing … there’s no mailing list you need to sign up for—you can see all the discussions on GitHub. Switching `master` branch to be called `main`—you can see when we did it, we did it in public. We have this discussion in issues.



*What is the “shape” of the community? Is there a “core team”? How often do you receive contributions from outside this group?*

**We’re very liberal and loose with giving people access to contribute, we want to get out of their way.** I know really amazing people who work on the repo. I wanted people who are going to take care of the community and not deal with the noise. Ex: I move certain issues or discussions to other places (Discourse) to prune the repo. I work on documentation.

*Could you tell us about how you express appreciation for your contributors’ work? I noticed your community uses all-contributors. Is there a larger philosophy behind this pattern?*

**This past two months I’ve been into the allcontributors bot, and it makes contributors so happy.**

**People get so excited.** I went to the all developers conference (we have 2 confs, 2015 and 2019) — we are very **intentional about calling it contributors** versus developers.
We have a p5 contributors zine that we release.
Our contributors take care of each other.

Tangent: If we do a new feature, it needs to be accessible. It’s very beginner friendly, it needs to be accessible to artists, not just developers. If I can’t do it in p5, I don’t want to have it at all.

*What behaviors do you want to encourage in your community? How do you encourage this behavior?*

Don't burn out - take care of yourself, take the time you need to do your own thing. Our main maintainer stepped down this year, and I'm just like, yes, take care of yourself.
Have you read our p5 manifesto?
Multiple worldiews

*How do you make sure people find reasonable ways to match their skillsets with what’s needed?*

We try not to have a hierarchy. **There’s no “you are the person in charge of this”, and we don’t compare contributions (“this contribution is better than this other contribution”). We say that all contributions are welcome.** We also try not to leave contributors hanging.
We would have a better community as people develop different worldviews.
We’re very intentional about being relaxed.
We never talk about productivity.

*You said that the community is a black hole of needs — there’s always more to be done.*

You can destroy yourself trying to address everything. We need to be healthy and working in the long run. You need to take care of yourself.
With love, and with care, we’ll figure it out.


*What (non-technical info) should people know about your community before they contribute? How do you communicate this to them? Is this method sufficient / successful?*

Contributing guidelines, community documentation, Code of Conduct – we are very intentional about laying the ground rules for participation

*What is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?*

**A lot of online spaces are geared towards male people, not women, non-binary folk. I see a lot of people who are shy.** It can be scary for someone to have a lot of information about you.
Coming from a place where it’s very restrictive (needing a phone number, proof of work, etc), I want to keep things optionable. There’s no binary (yes / no). For example, when you’re asked to identify yourself as a developer: y/no — it’s very binary! Or male/female, it’s not inclusive. It matters. (Speaking about GH forms -- sign up, I think).
My favorite forum is a Discourse — [monome lines forum](https://llllllll.co/). You go to most computer forum places, it’s not inclusive. But here, we talk about everything. It’s very open.
How do they make it open and inclusive?
There’s a community segment. There’s a code of conduct, that’s key.


*What motivates you to participate in this community?*

I apply myself to all this work because **I learn so much from it**. “The thing that makes the thing is more interesting than the thing”. I’m not a teacher or artist full-time. I want people in high school, middle school, to have access to study media arts. At that age, you have to choose what path you choose (humanist vs science/maths).
There is a lot of power in deploying a tool, and I want people to be mindful of the pitfalls. I think that **if we knew enough art and technology, we would be standing up to things like policing, facial recognition, etc.**


*How do you represent this work to the outside world? Do you want to? Does GitHub make this easier or harder?*

**I have so much joy when I say something subversive in software, and no one says anything to me.** A lot of my work has to do with mental health and resistance.

Yes, **I want to be able to share my work in p5 to the outside world.**
I work in arts, I work for beginners, I work in tiny increments, I work in the open. **You’ll see my entire process, the good and bad ideas I have had**. Here are the ways you can reach me. **Everyone has a snakey path in life, and I want people to be able to see mine, this can be very helpful to people.** All the best things that happened in my life have been accidental.
Computers should be about how to connect with people, not about trying to coerce people.
