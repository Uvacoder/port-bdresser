Interviewers: Bobby + Kathy

_Can you tell us a bit about yourself, your role with [your community ], and how you got involved?_
*   My json library. I began working on it while I was still at University, I was a researcher there. I had this side project..I learned about GH, put it on GH. I got really excited when the first person started using it and submitted a pull request. I didn’t understand why people spent their free time helping make my project better, and I wanted to express my gratitude to these people. I added them to the README, and it got bigger and bigger.. I wanted to show that it’s not just me that does everything. I want to encourage other people to contribute and help.
*   Last year,** I got merge requests where people were working on them for a year**. If I had to pay these people, I wouldn’t know how. Recognizing them… putting them in some sort of a record is my way of showing appreciation. I used the API to pull all the avatars of people who worked on this project.
*   I really enjoy doing this. It’s always the last thing I do before a release—collect all the avatars and … did they do more than what they did earlier… I try to collect it all. Maybe they fix a typo or something or maybe they do a lot more.

_Could you describe [your community]? How do contributions to [your community] work today? Is there a core team, and how often do you receive contributions from outside this team?_
* **Sometimes people communicate to me shyly that I forgot about [recognizing] them. I can tell it’s something that people really want.**
* In Hacktober, it’s the time where a lot of people make merge requests and spam, but I wanted to thank everyone’s contribution, even if it’s just fixing a typo.

_What behaviors do you want to encourage in your community? How do you encourage this behavior? What types of contributions would you like to see more of from your community?_

*   Before I make a release, I go through what happened since last release. If someone makes a lot of contributions just by commenting on an issue.. **A lot of the time, if they don’t contribute code, I don’t add them to the README**. If you have a nice idea, that’s 10%. Making the idea and passing CI is 90%. If someone goes all that way, it’s fine to say thank you.
*   **It’s a lot of work to code and implement ideas, saying the idea is just a small part of it.**
*   Sometimes people aren’t constructive at all. There were issues where.. Every once in a while, really rude comments. People explicitly come along to tell you they don’t like something, and I don’t react to it.
*   What I would like more... One problem I have as a maintainer is that right now, I encourage people with questions to open an issue. I always hope that it helps. That there is an archive of frequently asked questions. If someone does use search, they wouldn’t ask the same question over and over again. That’s one of the problems I have. Every time I make a release, new part of the community is using that, and they come with the same questions, same behaviors, and they could have accessed prior knowledge.
*   They post screenshots of their IDE and expect me to fix their code and I can’t copy and paste that!
*   I wish there was some magical way … like StackOverflow, let’s focus on a question. Let’s have some kind of answers, let’s upvote them.. Everything else can disappear, people can then just see the question and the answer!
*   No threading for issues, no threaded discussions. It’s ok for technical stuff, “here’s an error”, “ok let’s fix that”, etc. But not for discussions.
*   A second thing that would help: since I’m more or less working at my own pace, sometimes I would like to get an opinion on something. Sometimes I do something, then I get the feedback from people who care about that that they didn’t like it. I need to be able to surface these ideas so that people can offer feedback at the right time and in a productive way.

_How do newcomers find this community?_
*   They know the repository. I get emails sometimes…**”What’s the minimum amount of work I can do to add something to my CV?”. I feel they don’t want to contribute for the long term, but just to get a badge or something.** I’m lucky that my repository is the # 1 outside of the professional projects when you filter by C++
*   Most of the time, it comes up when I make a release. I make an announcement in Reddit in the C++ forum. I see a lot of discussions in the forums. Every once in a while, someone asks “Why can’t your lib do X?” and people might engage in discussion and it might result in contribution.

_Where do you interact with your community? How often?_
*   I always want to be the guy that pressed “merge”. I don’t want other people to do that. It’s too big for that risk.
*   Sometimes people ask me [what they need to do to get write access], like “What do I need to do to get there...to be the person who presses merge?” And I respond that “Even if you have worked with me for years..I need to trust them.”
*   I have no idea if I’m doing anything wrong when it comes to MIT license. I don’t care who you are until I am copy pasting your name into the README.

_Where else?_
*   Reddit is where I learn about updates from libraries. I know I can subscribe to releases on GH, but I want a human to be speaking to me about the release, not just a technical update.
*   I see that the communities .. the core C++ people … I feel like I reach the right guys on Reddit.
*   For ex: package management integrations. I do the announcement of the release there, and the magic happens. I don’t care or know where these people are, but it’s the single thing that I write, and the single thing I read.
*   So I don’t use other outlets for that.

_What information is helpful to know about the community members you're interacting with? How do you get this context?_
*   The library is always getting more and more mature. If someone starts changing things now.. The easy work is already done. Yes, lots of typos. But it’s not so easy to find work like that anymore. If I look at work I don’t understand, I’m not going to merge it. I had someone who participated a lot, and he’s not reachable anymore. They wrote that code, and now they’re gone! I can’t ask them about their code… and that’s problematic.
*   I use stalebot to keep the list clean. People don’t like it, but I am not getting paid for it and I need to be able to manage things. If you stop caring, I will stop caring, and the bot will clear things out.

_What motivates you to participate in this community?_
*   It got so big—first of all, teaching myself C++. Then teaching myself to do open source. Now it’s having a library that’s being used by a lot of people. It’s used because it’s the best. I use it myself. **I want to have this to be as good as it can be.** I won’t be able to have a second project in that area. I spend a lot of time there, and make it as easy as possible.
*   The more I grow professionally, the more effective I am at addressing the work that comes up. I can apply the learnings to my professional work.  **My private self helps my professional self, and vice versa. I can show people, “This is how I would write software without constraints”**
*   Having stars and whatnot on GH — that’s also cool. The Sponsors program is not as much [money] as I wish it could be. But it’s still nice.
*   Once you’re successful, it’s easy to say you’re motivated by that. But yes, I did put in a lot of work to get to this point.

_What drains you about participating in this community? What do you wish were different, or easier?_
*   Re: above—rude comments, unproductive discussions, answering same questions over and over again

_How do you represent this work to the outside world? Do you want to? Does GitHub make this easier or harder?_
*   **Well.. I have it in my CV now**. At my last job, for me, it leveled a bit of the discussion. They said, “You’re doing that project, I trust you.” I share it.
*   I know it’s used by a lot of people, and I don’t need to talk about it.** I enjoy if people recognize me for it without me telling them**. I’m not  like a VIP being recognized in the supermarket...like **they recognize me when I’m asking for help sometimes! That’s really nice.**

_Niels’ Other Ideas_
*   I don’t have a real website (add to profile README?)
*   Homepage for repo / community / org? All their websites are the same anyways. Let them put the info they have themselves
*   Core Infrastructure Initiative (Linux) – technical best practices around source code, security reporting, etc
    *   To get this badge, you have to answer all the questions – GitHub could make this easier by putting it in the project configuration
    *   Read up on this!
*   Epics / high-level planning (not just milestones etc)
    *   People always ask me “when is the next release?”
*   More statistics!
    *   Statistics right now don’t help much
    *   **Stars as popularity – would love to see evolution of stars over time**
    *   **Chart releases, views to website, stars, contributors together**
    *   More long-term data
    *   E.g., does Covid make people use or contribute to my project more? Less? I can’t tell
